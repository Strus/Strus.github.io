title: About Me
---
I am an experienced Software Engineer with a high drive for the development of high-quality software. I do not accept slackness, because I have full conviction that it leads to great problems in the future phases of project development. I always induce the best known coding practices and standards fitting for the current team and project I work in - I am often a person responsible for maintaining team/company Coding Standards. Programming is not only my job but also my passion.

Besides software development, I enjoy long walks and training with my Labrador Retriever, Lisa.
