During my career, I worked in many Agile/Scrum teams. I also had a unique opportunity to work with Special Forces soldiers, take part in their training operations, and see how they plan, execute and debrief their missions. I think that Software Development Teams can learn a lot from Special Forces, because similar to them, they need to be agile and quickly react to environmental changes.

In this article, I would like to describe some aspects of day-to-day work in software development and explain how they can be improved based on special operations forces’ knowledge.

## Team organization
One can recognize many similarities between modern Software Development and Special Forces Team:
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Agile Software Development Team</th>
        <th>Special Forces Team</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>small (up to 9 members)</td>
        <td>small (commonly from 4 to 6 members)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>self-organizing</td>
        <td>self-sufficient</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>individuals can have specialized skills, but there are no titles for team members</td>
        <td>operators have specializations, but „everyone is a shooter first”</td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Small size
A team must be small enough that one person can truly lead it. In a dynamic environment, you cannot manage directly over a dozen people effectively. You must find a team size that is manageable by a single leader and stick to it.

Special Forces teams commonly consist of 4 to 6 operators. Such size allows their team leader to manage every one of them - and also allows a given team to dynamically react to environmental changes because decision inertia is almost unnoticeable. If a mission requires more people, they are still divided into 4 to 6 man teams - and a couple of those teams has one senior commander. This commander then still leads directly only 4 to 6 people - the team leaders. But do not confuse leadership with micromanagement. Each one of these teams is still independent because the decentralized command is essential to success in a dynamic environment.

## Planning
### Planning is everyones job
In the planning phase, a small Special Forces team can do the work which in regular forces is assigned to a Battalion Headquarters. Every operator has an area of expertise and his job is to make sure that the operation plan is done in terms of this area. Team/Group leader is responsible for the plan as a whole and presents it to his superior. Everyone has a job to do.

In Software Development situation should be similar - every member of a team should take part in a planning process, as every member of a team can have viable insights of given task/user story/bug etc.

every iteration the team must provide in given time period can be treated as a mission to execute. It is important to have a goal other than „let’s do every task from the sprint backlog”, because if everyone in the team has the same clear vision of what we want to achive - they will be able to cooperate better.
