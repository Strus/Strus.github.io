Hello! My name is **Adrian Kepka**.

I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at **[Box](https://www.box.com/en-gb/home)**. I've been working on large C/C++ codebases for over 7 years and my goal is to create high quality and maintainable code.

I am also interested in building and coaching efficient teams. I am often involved in the process of maintaining company Coding Standards and I am conducting tech talks on a regular basis.

You can read more about me **[here](/about.html)** and see my recent coding stats below.
