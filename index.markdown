Hello! My name is **Adrian Kepka**.

I am currently a Staff Engineer and Technical Project Leader at **[TiVo](https://business.tivo.com)**. I've been working on large C/C++ codebases for over 5 years and my goal is to create high quality and maintainable code.

I am also interested in building and coaching efficient teams. I am involved in the process of maintaining company Coding Standards and I am conducting training about various technical topics on a regular basis.

You can read more about me **[here](/about.html)**, check my latest articles in the **["Blog"](/blog.html)** section, and see my recent coding stats below.
